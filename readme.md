# i8051-sim
Old project from time i was student - so few years ago. Done together with my friend to pass one of subjects.

Seven segment display got from [Seven-segment LED Control for .NET](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/37800/Seven-segment-LED-Control-for-NET) - so credits for that to that guy: [Dmitry Brant](https://dmitrybrant.com/)

If there is something else that it's not mine.. sorry i didn't remember after years passed. Please tell me.
